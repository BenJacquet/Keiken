RENDU :
1. How is permission granted to delete a file?

The access control checks if the user has the correct permissions on the directory containing the file and not the file itself, then deletes it if the conditions are met.

2. Create a file that your colleague can edit but not delete and another he can delete but not edit

touch first && chmod o+trw first
touch second && chmod o-tw second (The user must have read, write and execute permission on the directory)

3. Does it make sense to be able to assign such rights?

In my opinion both of these rights combinations of rights don't really make sense because:
- If the user can edit a file they can empty its content, making it useless except in the case of a program only needing its existence
- If the user can delete a file, it would make no sense to restrict write access except to prevent malicious code injection that could be executed with that file

4. What are the practical consequences of this experience?

See previous answers, but moreover, I discovered that directories permissions is the determining factor for file deletion, then comes the sticky bit.

ISSUES :
- Fichier non disponible lors le consultation (est-ce Unix & Linux ?)
- Lors de la lecture faut-il faire les exercices présents dans le livre ?

NOTES : 
- Peut etre ajouter lecture chapitre 6 à (Unix & Linux) pour l'exercice 3 (tres interessant), préciser un peu la question et donner quelques indications sur les parties attendues (uniquement le file system ou les services aussi ?)
