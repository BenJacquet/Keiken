# What is Google Dorking?

Google Dorking is a technique of hacking wherein the hacker can make advanced searches through specific queries in the search service to identify valuable data on the surface web or content that is hard to find through regular search. Often hackers call this technique Google hacking since they use the Google search engine to do the hack. At the core of this technique the hacker uses explicit modifiers to search queries.
