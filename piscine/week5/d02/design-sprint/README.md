# Design Sprint

<b>Life is too short to build something nobody wants.</b>

## What is a design sprint?
A design sprint is a collaborative process for solving complex problems through design, prototyping, and testing ideas with users. It's a variable length process that involves a cross-functional team working together to ideate, prototype, and test a solution to a problem or challenge. The process was developed by Jake Knapp at Google Ventures and has since been adopted by many organizations around the world.

## What does it not do?
A design sprint is <b>NOT</b> a formula that completely eliminates failure.
Nor will it allow you to magically obtain a pertinent product or service.

## What does it do?
It does not eliminates failure but it will, but thanks to it you will be able to detect it early enough.
And if something goes wrong, it will allow you to fail faster and provide a method to bounce back by getting immediate feedback.

## When can we use a design sprint?

### At the beginning of a project
You might use a design sprint to initiate a change in process or start the innova- tion of a product concept. This works well when you’re exploring opportunities with the goal of coming up with original concepts that ultimately will be tested in the real world—for example, if we need to understand how young parents would buy healthcare products online.

### In the middle of a project
You might use a design sprint to start a new cycle of updates, expanding on an ex- isting concept or exploring new ways to use an existing product. For example, we worked with a marketing data company that realized the data it gathered might be useful to other market segments. Building a prototype gave the team the validation it needed and prompted a deeper investment into that product segment, which ultimately was rewarded with a significant increase in sales.

### For a mature project
A design sprint can also be used to test a single feature or subcomponent of a prod- uct. This allows you to focus on a particular aspect of the design. For example, your team might need to know what improvements can be made to the onboarding pro- cess. Using the design sprint to discover the pros and cons of a new onboarding channel could give you granular insights into a high-return part of the product experience.

## Key takeaways
- A design sprint has five phases: <b>Understand</b>, <b>Diverge</b>, <b>Converge</b>, <b>Prototype</b>, and <b>Test</b>. The names of these phases may vary from company to company, but the overall ethos remains the same: a timeboxed design cycle completed in a collaborative fashion with real user input.
- The focus of a design sprint is to get the validation needed to maximize the chances of creating something people want.
- The process is very flexible and can adapt to different teams and needs.
- Design sprints can be measured in different ways, from number of “good” ideas generated, team alignment, company direction, and even halting a project.

## Why do a design sprint?
- <b>To profit from a test phase</b> that allows you get invaluable feedback throughout the process.
- <b>To increase speed, efficiency and focus</b> by providing hard deadlines, that our mind will unconsciously try to reach.
- <b>To align a diverse team</b> by enabling a co-creation effect where everyone's voice can be heard and new ideas are welcome, thus facilitating bonding.
- <b>To have a clear process</b> by defining structure and steps that are achievable and understood by everyone.
- <b>To start a new project in a clear direction</b>, because the first steps are always the most hazardous, assessing the situation quickly is primordial.

## When Not to Use a Design Sprint
- <b>The product is already very well-defined</b>, it would not be advised to reimplement part or most of it.
- <b>You lack significant use data and you cannot spend enough time obtaining it</b>, because design sprints require constant feedback to be effective.
- <b>The project is only a few days in scope</b>, because it would not make sense spending all your time in design sprints, right?
- <b>The business opportunity isn’t clear</b>, and thus you won't be able to determine direction or the value you provide.
- <b>The scope is far too broad</b>, you don't want to chew more than you can bite.
- <b>A more sophisticated product development effort is required</b>, a design sprint is the beginning of a conversation about a product, not the end of one.
- <b>You won’t break up with your idea: The IKEA effect</b>, you're too far gone, why would you change/sacrifice anything now?

### Takeaways
- A design sprint is useful when you need to reduce the risk of failure, gain efficiency, align a team, establish an initial process, or set the direction on a new effort.
- A design sprint is less useful in the following cases: when a product is already well defined, if significant additional research is needed, if the allotted time is too short, or if a business opportunity isn’t clear.
- A design sprint cannot accomplish everything, so scope appropriately. It is not a substitute for complex product development, nor if there’s an unwillingness in your organization for a change in direction.

## The prerequisites for a design sprint

### Determine the Timebox

### Construct the Agenda

### Set the Scope

### Pick a Facilitator

### Recruit and Inform Team Members

### Secure and Prepare the Space

### Stock Up on Supplies

### Conduct a Pre-Mortem

### Prepare and Distribute Background Materials

### Schedule Time with Users

## How to design sprint?
It revolves around five (6 with Iterate) non negociable actions:

### Understand
<b>Define and unpack the problem to solve</b>

### Diverge
<b>Generate ideas to solve this problem</b>

### Converge
<b>Decide which ideas to pursue for testing</b>

### Prototype
<b>Build a prototype users can play with</b>

### Test
<b>Validate your assumptions by observing prototype use</b>

### Iterate
- <b>Capture and Document</b>
- <b>Determine Next Steps </b>
- <b>Continue the Practice</b>
