# Design Thinking

## Steps

### Empathize
Start by understanding the needs, desires, and behaviors of your users. Conduct user research and gather data to gain insights into what your users are trying to accomplish and what their pain points are.


### Define
Define, precise and narrow problem.
Use information gathered from understanding your users, pinpoint the problem or problems you want to focus on.

### Ideate
Brainstorm a wide range of potential solutions to the problem. Encourage your team to come up with as many ideas as possible, and don't worry about whether they're feasible or not at this stage.

### Prototype
Create a rough prototype of your best idea. This can be a physical or digital prototype, depending on what you're designing.

### Test
Test your prototype with real users to get feedback on whether it solves the problem you defined in step two. Use this feedback to refine your prototype and iterate on your design.
