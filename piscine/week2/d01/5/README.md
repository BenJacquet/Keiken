## Goal
This code computes the prices of the beverages served in our coffe house.

We'd like you to add an optional cinnamon supplement that costs 0.05â‚¬
to all our existing catalog of beverages.

### My Solution:
I implemented a Drink class that will extend the Beverage interface and allow better flexibility.
I also added a Supplement interface that will be extended with specific classes.

Instead of using inheritence I went with composition as it is much more flexible and makes the overall code more manageable and readable.
