OSI Model Layer 7 - Application (Browser)

Requests are made using HTTP which itself generally uses TCP (Transmission Control Protocol - port 80)

4 Steps :
- The application opens a connection
- The application senda a request to the server
- The server sends a response to the browser
- The connection is closed

HTTP is a stateless protocol, which means it does not keep track of the connections.

Several methods have been found to improve it and allow persistence of data.

One of the first was through cookies, sets of data exchanged between client and server during an HTTP transaction.
They allowed some data to be written or read at any subsequent connection.

These cookies are very rudimental and don't offer a real state, the real hero here is SSL (Secure Sockets Layer).

It provides secure client and server authentication and real sessions.

HTTP versions 1.1 or newer allow persistence to avoid making multiple TCP connections for every ressource.

Caching is another mechanisms that reduces strain and traffic on networks and servers, by giving the possibility to store requests or responses that will not need to be sent again.

To make sure that the data is considered fresh, an expiration mechanism exists.
If the data is considered stale, it will need to check with the origin server if it is still usable and get the necessary pieces for that specific response.
